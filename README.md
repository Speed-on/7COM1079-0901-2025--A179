# Team Research and Development Project – Ford Vehicle Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **7COM1079 – Team Research and Development Project** at the University of Hertfordshire. The aim was to analyse an assigned dataset and answer a statistical research question using R, supported by visualisations and hypothesis testing.

Our research question focused on determining whether there is a **correlation between the mileage of Ford vehicles and their market price**.

## 📊 Dataset
**File:** `ford.csv`

The dataset includes:
- Price  
- Mileage  
- Year  
- Model  
- Fuel type  
- Transmission  

Only the variables relevant to the research question (Price and Mileage) were used for statistical testing.

## ❓ Research Question
**Is there a correlation between the mileage of Ford vehicles and their market price?**

- **Dependent variable:** Price  
- **Independent variable:** Mileage  

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Loaded and inspected in R  
- Checked numeric fields  
- Removed missing or invalid values  

### 2. Visualisation (Base R, not screenshots)
- Histogram of Mileage  
- Histogram of Price  
- Scatterplot of Mileage vs Price  

### 3. Statistical Testing
- Normality check using histograms  
- Pearson or Spearman correlation depending on distribution  
- Significance tested at α = 0.05  

## 📈 Findings
- Mileage distribution was non-normal.  
- Scatterplot showed a negative trend.  
- Correlation results revealed a **significant negative relationship**.  
- Vehicles with higher mileage tend to have lower prices.

Full outputs are included in the final report and Appendices.



## 🔧 Running the R Analysis
